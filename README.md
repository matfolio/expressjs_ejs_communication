# expressjs_ejs_communication
### This application was built on the expressjs_ejs boilerplate previously done. It is an application that has information of Library, Books and staffs in a library. The information are kept JSON format. The data is hard coded into the app for brevity. There is a project in one the of my repos on MongoDB driver using Mongoose package.
